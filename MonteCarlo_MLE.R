# generate 100 random unifomly distributed numnbers between 0 and 1

# then generate a dummy or Bernaulli random variable y that equals one if the
# uniform random numbers is greater than 0.4.

# That is, the Bernoulli variable
#equals one with probability of 0.6. By doing simulation, we know the true parameter
#is p = 0.6.
